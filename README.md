# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors!

> This was my second time working with python. I decided I wanted to
> make some sort of quick easy game and had the goal at the beginning of
> having a game that could be played in a loop as I had never tried
> using a loop in python before. I learned a good amount doing this
> project especially when it comes to the importance of organizing code,
> how loops work and just reenforcing the basics I had learned before.
>
> I
> used a tutorial found at
> (<https://realpython.com/python-rock-paper-scissors/>) to help me get
> started. The first phase of the project was just getting the basic
> structure working. Starting with the basics of the game. Getting the
> user input out of 3 options, rock paper or scissors. Generating a move
> by the computer by using an option at random. I had used variables
> like this before so this was fairly quick and easy. Then setting a
> table of all the possible moves and outcomes, printing the outcome of
> the game to show a winner. Below image is the first successful run of
> code where we had a working game.

> This ran the basic game, would show you a winner, but didn’t allow you
> to play multiple times in a row without closing and reloading the
> script as well as it did not keep score which is something I wanted to
> figure out how to do. So for phase two I had two goals, make it loop
> and find a way to keep score. The tutorial I used to get going didn’t
> cover how to create a loop very well, but after doing some more
> searching on google I learned my first lesson that I will consider a
> valuable takeaway, indentions matter! I didn’t realize until 5 minutes
> of messing around with it that the whole code was breaking because I
> didn’t have things properly indented. After getting the loop working,
> I was able to add lines to keep score. After accomplishing both of the
> main goals I had for this step I realized if I typed in my option
> wrong such as misspelling my move for example, that the scoreboard
> wouldn’t update, and I realized I needed a better way to display that
> your move was invalid or not accepted by the game. So I added the
> input error variable to check when printing results. At this point I
> wondered about adding a system to check for common misspelling or
> different ways to type the move and have the game automatically accept
> close or similar answers by having a library maybe to compare against
> to count as a move, like for example ROCK, Rock, rockk, could be
> accepted as rock. But I was coding this on my lunch break in an hour
> of free time I had and decided I was happy with just having it loop
> back through so they could try again so I could finish this project
> and move on to the next one. The below image shows several round in
> row, keeping score over each round and how it will handle an error on
> the user input.
>
> I was able to learn quite a bit even on such a short simple project.
> My biggest takeaways were the importance of the order of your code,
> proper indention, and also this was the most if/elif/else style of
> statements I have ever use so managing them properly and not messing
> up the syntax was good practice. Most of all though I was happy to
> implement a loop properly for the first time.
